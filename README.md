# My Hangman game

This project is a hangman game made by Gareth Geldenhuys, The game is very simple select letters and try to guess the correct word - If you run out of guess you loose if you manage to solve the word your highscore increases and you get to go again.
Personal Highscore - 9 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `How to play`
The user can select letters from the circle of letters on the left When I use selects a correct letter the word at the top will fill in where that letter is suppose to go- If the user selects a wrong letter a part of the hangman is drawn. If the user gets all the letters in the word above and the hangman has not been completed the user Wins - Great Job 
If the hangman get completed before the user has guess all the letters in the word the user loses. If the user wins their highscore increases by one if the user Loses their highscore is reduced to 0. The game is reset after both conditions the exception being that the highscore gets increased by one if the user wins and gets set to 0 if they lose - The user can also click the help screen if they need further instructions on how to play or the user can click the reset button as well - This also resets the highscore. (Thats it :)- Happy Hanging
